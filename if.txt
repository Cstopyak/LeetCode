} else {
    console.log("the opposite case ran");
}

else if
used in conjunction with the if-statement toe xecute code based on another condition
if(condition){
    ...
} else if{
    ...
}

if ( a >4){
    console.log("the number is greater than 4);
} else if ( a % 2 == 0){
    alert("else/if has run!")
